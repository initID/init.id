Unprofessional Excellence in Every Pixel!

## About Page

At init.id, we embrace the chaos of creativity and revel in the joy of whimsical game development. As a one-person game dev studio based in Surabaya, Indonesia, we proudly embrace the unprofessional, quirky, and unconventional side of game development. We're not your typical company or team - just an indie developer following our passion and sharing our quirky creations with the world.

Our games are the result of spontaneous bursts of inspiration and the thrilling energy of participating in Game Jams. We love exploring new ideas, experimenting with unique mechanics, and pushing the boundaries of what games can be. From silly adventures to mind-bending puzzles, our creations are a testament to our unorthodox approach to game development.

Join us on this unconventional journey as we continue to craft games with a dash of randomness, a sprinkle of humor, and a whole lot of heart. While we may not conform to traditional professionalism, we're driven by the pure enjoyment of making games and the desire to bring a smile to your face. Welcome to init.id, where being unprofessional is our badge of honor.
